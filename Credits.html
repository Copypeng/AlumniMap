                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

9. License Requirements. Google's licenses above are subject to your adherence to 
the following requirements:

9.1 Free, Public Accessibility to Your Maps API Implementation.

9.1.1 General Rules.

(a) Free Access (No Fees). Your Maps API Implementation must be generally accessible
 to users without charge and must not require a fee-based subscription or other fee-based 
 restricted access. This rule applies to Your Content and any other content in your Maps 
 API Implementation, whether Your Content or the other content is in existence now or is
  added later.

(b) Public Access (No Firewall). Your Maps API implementation must not operate (i) only 
behind a firewall; or (ii) only on an internal network (except during the development 
and testing phase); or (iii) in a closed community (for example, through invitation-only access).

9.1.2 Exceptions.

(a) Enterprise Agreement with Google. The rules in Section 9.1.1 (Free Access, Public Access) 
do not apply if you have entered into a separate written agreement with Google (such as a 
Google Enterprise agreement) or obtained Google's written permission.

(b) Mobile Applications.
(i) The rule in Section 9.1.1(a) (Free Access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation
 is used in a mobile application that is sold for a fee through an online store and is 
 downloadable to a mobile device that can access the online store. 

(ii) The rule in Section 9.1.1(b) (Public Access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation
 is an Android application that uses the Google Maps Android API. (However, the rule in
  Section 9.1.1(b) (Public Access) will continue to apply if your Maps API Implementation 
  is an Android application that uses any other Maps APIs, unless the Maps API 
  Implementation qualifies for the exception in Section 9.1.2(a) (Enterprise Agreement with Google).)


9.1.3 Examples.

(a) You can require users to log in to your Maps API Implementation if you do not require user
s to pay a fee.

(b) You can charge a fee for your Maps API Implementation if it is an Android application 
downloadable to mobile devices from the Android Market.

(c) If you are a consultant who creates or hosts Maps API Implementations 
for third party customers, you may charge such customers a fee for your 
consulting or hosting services (but not for the Maps API Implementations
 themselves, except as permitted under Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions)).
9.2 Reporting. You must implement those reporting mechanisms that Google 
has set forth and may update from time to time in these Terms and in the 
Maps APIs Documentation. For example, as specified in the Maps API Documentation,
 you agree to provide reports to Google if your Maps API Implementation enables 
 a device to detect its own location through use of a sensor (including but not 
 limited to GPS, cell triangulation, WiFi or similar functionality) to display 
 the location of the device on a map or to calculate a route.

9.3 End User Terms and Privacy Policy. If you develop a Maps API Implementation 
for use by other users, you must:

(a) display to the users of your Maps API Implementation the link to Google's 
Terms of Use as presented through the Service or described in the Maps APIs
 Documentation;

(b) explicitly state in your Maps API Implementation's terms of use that, by 
using your Maps API Implementation, your users are agreeing to be bound by
 Google's Terms of Use; and

(c) protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. 

(i) You must make publicly available, and must abide by, an appropriate privacy
 policy in your Maps API Implementation. In particular, if your Maps API 
 Implementation enables you or any party to gain access to information about 
 users of the Maps API(s), including but not limited to personally identifiable
  information (such as user names) or non-personally identifiable usage information 
  (such as location), your privacy policy must describe your 
 use and retention of this information.

(ii) Your privacy policy must notify users that you are using the Maps API(s) and
 incorporate by reference the Google privacy policy by including a link to the
  Google privacy policy (currently http://www.google.com/privacy.html), as 
  amended by Google from time to time.

9.4 Attribution. 
(a) Content provided to you through the Service may contain the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand 
features of Google, its partners, or other third party rights holders of content
 indexed by Google. When Google provides this attribution, you must display 
 it as provided through the Service or as described in the Maps APIs Documentation
 and may not delete or in any manner alter these trade names, trademarks, service
  marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

(b) You agree to include and display the "powered by Google" attribution 
(and/or any other attribution(s) required by Google as described in the Maps 
APIs Documentation) conspicuously on the page, in close proximity and adjacent 
to the Service search box and Google search results. If you use the standard Google 
search control, or the standard Google search control form, this attribution will
 be included automatically, and you agree not to modify or obscure this 
 automatically-generated attribution.

(c) You understand and agree that Google has the sole right and discretion to determine
 whether your attribution(s) are in compliance with the above requirements.

9.5 Responsibility for Breaches. You agree that you are solely responsible for 
(and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach
of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences of any such breach 
(including any loss or damage that Google may suffer).
